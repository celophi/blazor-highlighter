# blazor-highlighter

Highlights webpage elements that use custom attributes typically added by Microsoft's Blazor framework during rendering.

## What is it?
A Developer Tool for Identifying and Visualizing Blazor-Generated Webpage Elements.

This [browser extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/blazor-highlighter/lcnepdfhaddkhfgflfcbiickhdcnhcmh) is designed for developers, engineers, and curious technologists who work with or analyze web applications built using Blazor, a modern web UI framework created by Microsoft that allows developers to build rich, interactive web interfaces using C# instead of JavaScript.

### How does it work?
When enabled, the extension scans the structure of the current webpage’s HTML and searches for patterns and attributes commonly generated by Blazor during the rendering process—such as custom attributes or auto-generated component identifiers. These indicators are often embedded in the DOM as part of Blazor's rendering lifecycle and component management.

Once detected, the extension applies a distinctive background color or visual marker to the matching elements. This visual overlay enables developers to quickly and intuitively identify which parts of the page are likely the result of Blazor’s rendering engine, without having to manually sift through deeply nested HTML or rely on DevTools alone.

### Why should you use it?
This tool is particularly useful for:
- Debugging Blazor component rendering in live web environments
- Reverse engineering or auditing existing Blazor-based web applications
- Learning how Blazor structures its output for educational or research purposes
- Gaining insight into component boundaries or client-side/server-side rendering behaviors

Whether you're building with Blazor, analyzing a site that uses it, or simply curious about how Blazor-generated markup looks in the wild, this extension provides a clear and immediate way to identify those elements directly within the page—no manual inspection required.
